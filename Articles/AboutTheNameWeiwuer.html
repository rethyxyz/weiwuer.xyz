<p>What is Weiwuer? The name "Weiwuer" is "Uyghur" written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Pinyin</a>. Pinyin is anglicized Mandarin. <b><i>It is not political</i></b>, I just like the Uyghurs.</p>

<p>I originally wanted the Uyghur domain. Unsurprisingly, it was taken. As I still wanted something Uyghur-related, I opted for the Pinyin version. So, here I have it. Thanks to Pinyin, there are a lot of untapped domains that have cool meaning to <i>those-in-the-know</i>.</p>

<p>You can't expect the Chinese (or Japanese) to have keyboards with thousands of keys, can you?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Pinyin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese">Romaji</a> are topics I'll talk about separately at some point.</p>
