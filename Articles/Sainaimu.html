<h1>Sainaimu: Autonomous SSH Auto-Blocker</h1>
<p>2022-06-17 09:21:54</p>
<p>I made Sainaimu, an SSH blocker for Linux servers a few weeks ago. It works with <code>ufw</code>, and is purely configurable using a <code>JSON</code> configuration file.</p>

<p>I feel like it could be used by any computer professional. I'm not sure if that's factual. In the future, I'll continue to make it more user friendly, as the concept is simple, with or without the use of the configuration file.</p>
